## Development Prerequisites

This project uses a `Makefile` to run tests, linting, and formatting tasks. Make sure `make` is installed and available on your `PATH` before using the project commands.

On macOS, `make` is typically provided by Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Common development commands:

```bash
make test
make test-unit
make test-ui
make lint
make format
make style
```

## Coding Agent Skills

The repository includes four coding agent skills in [`.agents/skills`](.agents/skills). Each skill provides a `SKILL.md` entry point and supporting reference material for writing and reviewing Swift code. These are development guidance for coding agents, not app dependencies.

| Skill | When to use it |
| --- | --- |
| [swiftui-pro](.agents/skills/swiftui-pro/SKILL.md) | Building or reviewing SwiftUI views, data flow, navigation, accessibility, and performance across the app's platform-specific surfaces. |
| [swift-concurrency-pro](.agents/skills/swift-concurrency-pro/SKILL.md) | Working with async/await, actor isolation, structured concurrency, task cancellation, and Swift 6.2 concurrency diagnostics. |
| [swift-testing-pro](.agents/skills/swift-testing-pro/SKILL.md) | Writing or reviewing Swift Testing unit and integration tests, including assertions, dependency injection, and async behavior. Its guidance retains XCTest for UI tests. |
| [swiftdata-pro](.agents/skills/swiftdata-pro/SKILL.md) | Adding or reviewing SwiftData persistence, including models, relationships, predicates, indexing, and CloudKit constraints when applicable. |

To request a focused review, name the relevant skill in your coding agent prompt. For example:

```text
Use swift-concurrency-pro to review TimerEngine for actor isolation and cancellation issues.
Use swift-testing-pro to add unit tests for timer phase transitions.
Use swiftui-pro to review the timer views for accessibility and data flow.
```

Agents should read the relevant `SKILL.md` and load the supporting references needed for the task. Use these skills alongside [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which documents the repository's architecture, coding conventions, and testing expectations.

The bundled skills are authored by Paul Hudson and distributed under the MIT license. [skills-lock.json](skills-lock.json) records their upstream GitHub sources, skill paths, and content hashes; consult it when tracking the installed skill sources or reviewing updates.
